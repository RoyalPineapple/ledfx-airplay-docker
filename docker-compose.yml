# Airglow - AirPlay ➜ LedFX Stack
#
# This stack provides AirPlay 2 audio streaming to LedFX for real-time LED visualization.
# Audio flows: AirPlay Device → Shairport-Sync → PulseAudio → LedFX → LED Devices
#
# Host networking is required for:
# - mDNS/Bonjour discovery (AirPlay device detection)
# - E1.31/UDP LED protocols (direct host network access)
# - Simplified audio routing between containers
#
# Security Note: Host networking gives containers direct network access.
# Only run this on trusted networks.
