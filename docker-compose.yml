# Airglow - AirPlay ➜ LedFX Stack
#
# This stack provides AirPlay 2 audio streaming to LedFX for real-time LED visualization.
# Audio flows: AirPlay Device → Shairport-Sync → PulseAudio → LedFX → LED Devices
#
# Network Architecture:
# - airglow-web: Bridge networking (port 8080 exposed)
# - ledfx: Bridge networking (ports 8888, 5568, 6454, 21324, 4048, 8889, 4002, 4003 exposed)
#   Note: Philips Hue uses outbound HTTP/HTTPS (80/443) - no ports exposed
# - shairport-sync: Macvlan networking (real IP 192.168.2.202 on physical network)
#   Uses built-in Avahi daemon (included in mikebrady/shairport-sync image) for mDNS advertisement
#   Also connected to bridge network to reach LedFX container
# Note: All services use bridge networking except shairport-sync, which uses macvlan to get
# a real IP on the physical network. This allows it to advertise correctly via its built-in Avahi.
# NQPTP and shairport-sync communicate via shared memory (/dev/shm) for AirPlay 2 timing
# synchronization (provided by shairport-sync's internal nqptp).

      - "4003:4003/udp"  # Govee device control (send commands to device)
      # Note: Philips Hue uses outbound HTTP/HTTPS (ports 80/443) to Hue Bridge
      # No ports need to be exposed - LEDFX makes outbound connections to the bridge
      # Note: LIFX uses outbound UDP (port 56700) for device communication
      # No ports need to be exposed - LEDFX sends commands and receives responses automatically
      # Note: Nanoleaf uses outbound HTTP (port 16021) and UDP (port 60222/60221) for device communication
      # No ports need to be exposed - LEDFX makes outbound connections to the device
      # Note: OpenPixelControl uses outbound UDP (port 7890) for device communication
      # No ports need to be exposed - LEDFX sends pixel data to OPC devices
      # Note: OpenRGB uses outbound TCP (port 6742 default) to OpenRGB SDK server
      # No ports need to be exposed - LEDFX connects to OpenRGB server on host/network
      # Note: OSC (Open Sound Control) uses outbound UDP (port 9000 default, configurable)
      # No ports need to be exposed - LEDFX sends OSC messages to OSC servers
      # Note: Novation Launchpad uses USB MIDI (via rtmidi library)
      # No network ports needed - requires USB device passthrough if used
      # Note: RPi WS281X uses Raspberry Pi GPIO pins (local hardware interface)
      # No network ports needed - requires GPIO access and /dev/mem if used in Docker
      # Note: Twinkly Squares uses outbound HTTP/HTTPS and UDP (port 7777) for real-time frames
      # No ports need to be exposed - LEDFX connects to Twinkly devices
      # Note: Zengge/MagicHome/FluxLED uses outbound UDP (port 5577) for device control
      # No ports need to be exposed - LEDFX sends commands to FluxLED devices
      # Note: UDP Realtime Device uses configurable UDP ports (default 21324, same as WLED UDP)
      # No additional ports needed - uses same ports as WLED UDP protocol
