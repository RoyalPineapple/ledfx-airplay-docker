# Airglow - AirPlay ➜ LedFX Stack
#
# This stack provides AirPlay 2 audio streaming to LedFX for real-time LED visualization.
# Audio flows: AirPlay Device → Shairport-Sync → PulseAudio → LedFX → LED Devices
#
# Network Architecture:
# - airglow-web: Bridge networking (port 8080 exposed)
# - ledfx: Bridge networking (ports 8888, 5568, 21324, 4048, 4002, 4003 exposed)
# - shairport-sync: Host networking (required for mDNS/Bonjour AirPlay discovery)
#
# Note: shairport-sync uses host networking for mDNS/Bonjour AirPlay discovery.
# ledfx uses bridge networking with port mappings for LED device communication.
